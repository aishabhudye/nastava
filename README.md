Overview
NASTAVA is an open-access learning platform designed to provide free, high-quality educational resources for GCSE students. The goal is to break down barriers to learning and empower students of all abilities to excel in their exams by offering easy access to multiple-choice quizzes, video tutorials, and past exam papers.

Note: This website is optimized for 1920 x 1080 screen resolution.

Key Features
Intuitive Navigation
The website features a clean, user-friendly navigation structure. The homepage links directly to individual subject landing pages, ensuring users can easily explore content. Consistent navigation links in the header and main body guarantee smooth movement throughout the site.

Diverse Learning Resources
Each subject offers multiple-choice questions, tutorial videos, and downloadable past exam papers, helping students prepare for their exams in multiple ways.

Interactive Design
Hover effects and responsive buttons enhance usability, providing clear visual cues for actions. The Science section includes a fully functional quiz feature with instant feedback to help students assess their understanding.

Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3

Standard HTML tags for content structure (<div>, <a>, <img>, etc.)
CSS for layout and design, including hover effects, consistent color schemes, and visual feedback on interactions.
Design Considerations
The website currently supports a 1920 x 1080 viewport. Future updates will include responsive design for a wider range of devices and screen sizes.

Core Functionalities
Front-End Authentication UI
Sign-up and sign-in buttons are included for potential future back-end integration, where users could create personalized accounts and track their progress.

Interactive Quizzes
The Science section features fully interactive quizzes, providing instant feedback on student performance without the need for a back-end server.

Lessons Learned
HTML & CSS Mastery
Through this project, we deepened our understanding of structuring content with HTML5 and crafting visually appealing, user-friendly designs using CSS.

GitHub Collaboration
GitHub was instrumental in hosting and version controlling the project. We gained practical experience in pushing and pulling code and utilizing GitHub Pages for site deployment.

Future Enhancements
Back-End Integration
Future development could include back-end functionality for user authentication, data storage, and personalization, allowing users to save their quiz progress and access customized content.

Improved Team Collaboration
More advanced use of GitHubâ€™s collaboration tools would streamline the process of working on shared files, particularly CSS, to enhance team productivity.

Responsive Design
Expanding the design to include responsive elements will ensure the website functions optimally on a range of screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
